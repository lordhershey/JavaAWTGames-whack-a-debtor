When I was hired by my current employer back in 2002, it was a left over rement of a call center. The copany at that time was called Marlin Holdings. The company has since morphed and changed and ultimatly bought by FICO. Back in the Marlin Holdings days I would make some debt collection themed game written in Java to sent to the annual Users Conference. This was the first one.

back in 2003 to show at a user conference.
it could use some cleaning up.
